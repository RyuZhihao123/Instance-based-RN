## Experiments1: Our new tasks. 
(These experiments focus on verifying the generalization ability of networks.)

* **Task1.1: PieNumber.**

> In this task, the `object number` are different between `training` and `testing sets`. By default, each pie chart in training sets contains 3 to 6 pie sectors, while the chart in testing sets contains 7 to 9 pie sectors.




## Experiments2: ClevelandMcGill
(The experiments that are same as Daniel's paper.)
